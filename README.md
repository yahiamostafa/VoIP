This repo contains two main Parts:
### 1) Voice Over IP VoIP
In This part, two hosts need to communicate with each other (both are in the same network).
But before we start, There are some permissions that must be given to the application in order to work.
1) Record Audio.
2) Modify Audio Setting.

You can find them in the manifest file [here](app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)
